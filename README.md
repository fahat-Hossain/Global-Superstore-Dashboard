# Global-Superstore-Dashboard by using Tableau 
Data visualization on Global superstore datasets by using Tableau Desktop. Before visualizing this project I created two column for
1. total profit (Profit * Quantity) and
2. Delivery time (Shipping date - Order date)

Measurement of this project is as follows:
1. Total profit
2. Average Delivery time (round to 4 days)
3. Average Sales revenue
4. Average product discount
5. Top 10 countries by profit
6. Average sales based on country (Map)
7. Average sales by Sub-category (position also showed)
8. Market wise customer acquisition per month

You can also filter Market and sub-category
